  Romana is a new open source Software Defined Network (SDN) solution that lets data center operators design and deploy multi-tenant cloud computing networks directly on their physical infrastructure without a virtual network overlay. Romana based networks are less expensive to build, easier to operate and deliver higher performance than overlay-based virtual networks.
