Building and operating scalable, high-performance multi-tenant cloud computing networks is extremely difficult.  Today's preferred solution is to deploy a virtual network overlay using VXLANs and an Enterprise SDN controller available from Cisco (ACI), VMware (NSX/Nicira), Juniper (Contrail), Nuage (VSP) or one of several smaller startups. These solutions were designed to address the difficulties of deploying virtual machines within an enterprise network and are ill-suited to the challenges of the emerging container-based and Cloud Native architectural style. Specifically, the explosion in the number of network endpoints, tighter integration with cloud management systems such as Docker and Kuberbetes and a desire for more flexible, hybrid cloud deployments demand a fresh approach to building and managing scalable, high-performance multi-tenant networks. 
Pani Networks' approach to building cloud networks begins top down, based on Cloud Native application requirements, and not bottoms up in an attempt to virtualize every low level enterprise network function. The result is a streamlined Cloud Native SDN platform that includes only what is necessary to build scalable, manageable high-performance multi-tenant networks. 

Cloud Native SDN allows operators to build cloud networks with their existing physical network and security infrastructure without an overlay or tunnel endpoints, eliminating the need for an Enterprise SDN solution.  Eliminating virtual network encapsulation and VXLAN routing results in simpler networks with more direct traffic paths, which are faster and easier to build and operate. Also, since there is no virtual network, all standard layer 3 traffic steering and filtering techniques can be applied (in physical or virtual form factors) for consistent policy based control.  Other layer 3 based cloud networking alternatives exist, but none offer the combination of performance, simplicity and control enabled by the Pani solution. Feedback from leading cloud operators to date has been enthusiastic. 
The company's plan is to aggressively promote the open source Cloud Native SDN solution as a replacement for all Enterprise SDN and make it the de facto standard for cloud networks. If the company achieves this goal, it will dominate the market for cloud networking and generate significant sustainable revenue selling its commercial offering
