Building and operating scalable, high-performance multi-tenant cloud computing
networks is extremely difficult. *(Comment: Would get rid of 'extremely'. Also,
you're making a bold claim, so some sources or reasons for the claim are
needed. It's probably sufficient to point out that this topic receives the most
attention in support forums, or that the complexities of this are legend...
just some sort of acknowledgment that you didn't just make this claim
yourself.)* Today's preferred solution is to deploy a virtual network using VXLAN overlays and a commercial Enterprise SDN controller. 

These solutions *(Comment: Which 'solutions'? Above you mentioned only one...)* were designed to address the challenges of deploying virtual machines on an enterprise network and are ill-suited to the challenges of the emerging container-based and Cloud Native architectural style. 

Specifically, the explosion in the number of network endpoints, tighter integration with cloud management systems such as Docker and Kubernetes, and a desire for more flexible, hybrid cloud deployments demand a fresh approach to building and managing scalable, high-performance multi-tenant networks. 

We call this new approach *Cloud Native SDN.*
