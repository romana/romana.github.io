All the code is available right now [here](http://www.github.com/romana/romana) on GitHub.

If you want to get involved, start by downloading the software and [trying it out for yourself](/try_romana/). Join the [Romana community on Slack](http://romana.slack.com) to get your questions answered directly. If you don't have access already, send us an [email](mailto:info@romana.io) for an invite.

We are taking pull requests and looking for contributors to join the effort. We're working on specific near term improvements, as well as major new features for the next release. See our [Roadmap](/Roadmap/) or the [open issues](http://www.github.com/romana/romana/issues) on GitHub for more detail.
