Building and operating scalable, high-performance multi-tenant cloud computing networks is extremely difficult.  Today's preferred solution is to deploy a virtual network using VXLAN overlays and a commercial Enterprise SDN controller.

These bverlay based virtual networks were designed to address the challenges of deploying virtual machines on an enterprise network and are ill-suited to the challenges of the emerging container-based and Cloud Native architectural style. 

Specifically, the explosion in the number of network endpoints, tighter integration with cloud management systems such as Docker and Kubernetes, and a desire for more flexible, hybrid cloud deployments demand a fresh approach to building and managing scalable, high-performance multi-tenant networks. 

We call this new approach *Cloud Native SDN.*
