These are the Romana Project Pages hosted on GitHub and available at [romana.github.io](romana.github.io). Also available at [romana.io](romana.io)

The site is based on a Jekyll Material Lite blog [template]( https://github.com/mudpuddle/jekyll-mdl), with some slight modifications to accommodate our static content requirements.

The site is organized around content topics that are organized as Jekyll blog 'categories'. This way there a separate folder is created in the repo that holds the various articles about that topic. 

This also allows for a separate README.md file for each category that lets us review the content and add comments on Github directly.

During the content drafting phase, all the content related a topic will be in the single README.md file in the topic folder. Once that reaches some level of stability, that file may be split up into several smaller chunks by copying the content in to sequential blog posts.

The first topic being drafted is the 'How does it Work' section. If you go into that folder now you will see all the content included in the repo's README.md file. You will also find this same file with a date prepended to the filename. This is to let Jekyll render the html for display. Except for the file name, these two files are identical 

There might be better ways to organize this content, so if you have any suggestions, please open an issue
