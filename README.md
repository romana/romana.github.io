These are the Romana Project Pages hosted on GitHub and available at [romana.io](romana.io) (and [romana.github.io](romana.github.io))

The site is based on a Jekyll Material Lite blog [template]( https://github.com/mudpuddle/jekyll-mdl), with some modifications to accommodate our static content requirements. We have changed their blog format to a text heavy site with direct navigation.

Each page is a Jekyll markdown file using the 'page' layout template. Navigation is organized into folders. The top nav bar is built by Jekyll. Each folder gets it's own nav button with a drop down menu with links to individual pages. Placement and text of the entries in the menus is derived from the values of 'firstnav' and 'secondnav' tags on the page.

To comment on these pages, make a branch of this repository and make your comments directly in the page markup file. Generate a pull request so everyone to see your comments.

If you want to render the site locally, you will have to install Jekyll on your laptop. See details [here](help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).
