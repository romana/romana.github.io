Romana v0.9.3 lets you apply network policy to your Kubernetes pods. You can use Romana to deploy Kubernetes in EC2 or on VMs running on your laptop with Vagrant as well as on stand alone machines. In addition, Romana supports the new [Network Policy API](/blog/MeetupDemo/) included in Kubernetes v1.3. 

If you want to run Kubernetes with a simple, transparent, high performance network, just install Romana and you'll be on your way. See the installation details in the Github repository [README]( https://github.com/romana/romana) to get started. Later, after you have everything working the way you want, you can add advanced Network Policies as without any disruption.
