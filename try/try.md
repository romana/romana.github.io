Romana v0.1 lets you build isolated multi-tenant networks in OpenStack on Amazon EC2 without an overlay network. You will need your own AWS account to launch the instances. See our [Roadmap](/Roadmap) for what the current release is able to do. 

We will be updating this release to also include a local deployment option using Vagrant.

Visit our Github [repository](http://www.github.com/romana) for details on how to set up your environment and get started.
