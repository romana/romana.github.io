Romana is a new open source Software Defined Network (SDN) solution specifically designed for Cloud Native applications. Romana allows multi-tenant cloud computing networks for OpenStack, Docker and Kubernetes to be built without encapsulation or a virtual network overlay. 

Romana networks are less expensive to build, easier to operate and deliver higher performance than networks built using alternative overlay based SDN designs.
