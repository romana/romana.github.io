### Welcome to the Romana Project

---

Romana is a new Software Defined Network solution specifically designed for Cloud Native applications. Romana allows multi-tenant cloud computing networks for OpenStack, Docker and Kubernetes to be built without encapsulation or a virtual network overlay. 

Romana networks are less expensive to build, easier to operate and deliver higher performance than networks built using alternative overlay based SDN designs. Its innovative layer 3 approach enables seamless hybrid cloud deployment and lets container orchestration systems transparently scale capacity across private and public clouds worldwide.

Romana is all open source and available today. The [current v0.6 release](/code/) lets you [build OpenStack](/try_romana/openstack/) and [Kubernetes](/try_romana/kubernetes/) clusters in EC2 with multi-tenant network isolation. 

There's still a lot to do before its finished and we'd love some [help](/code/).

Get started by learning about [Cloud Native Networks](/cloud/cloud_native_networks/).
