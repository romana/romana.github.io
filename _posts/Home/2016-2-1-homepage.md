### Welcome to the Romana Project

---

Romana is a new network and security automation solution for Cloud Native applications. Romana automates the creation of isolated *Cloud Native Networks* and secures applications with a distributed firewall that applies access control policies consistently across all endpoints and services, wherever they run. 

Romana applies network policy and secures applications on standard layer 3 networks so they can be deployed easily on public and private clouds, and even across the internet. 

Integration with [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) and other cloud orchestration systems lets application developers use their existing tools and workflow to apply network policy to their applications with the deployment flexibility they need.

Cloud Native Networks are easier to operate and deliver higher performance than networks built using overlay virtual networks. Romana's innovative layer 3 approach enables seamless hybrid cloud deployment and lets container orchestration systems transparently scale capacity across private and public clouds worldwide.

Romana is all open source and is deployed successfully today on servers running thousands of container workloads by operators of some of the largest on-line applications. The [current v0.9.8 release](/code/) lets you build [Kubernetes](/try_romana/kubernetes/) and [OpenStack](/try_romana/installation/) clusters with secure, isolated networks and policy based control. Romana runs in any IaaS, so application developers running Kubernetes in a public cloud now have a way to apply network and security policies to all pod communications. 

#### Romana v0.9.8 Available Now

Romana v0.9.8 was just [released](https://github.com/romana/romana) and has many new features and enhancements to improve performance, scalability and manageability. More details [here](/blog/release0-9-8/).
