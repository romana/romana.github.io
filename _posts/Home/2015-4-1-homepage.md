### Software Defined Networking for Cloud Native Applications

Romana is a new Software Defined Network (SDN) solution specifically designed for the unique requirement of [Cloud Native](https://cncf.io/) applications.

Romana lets data center operators design and deploy multi-tenant cloud computing networks directly on their physical infrastructure without a virtual network overlay. Romana based networks are less expensive to build, easier to operate and deliver higher performance than overlay-based virtual networks. 

By eliminating encapsulation and avoiding Neutron routers on remote hosts, Romana delivers over six times faster packet response times for common OpenStack traffic patterns. By avoiding the additional encapsulation required for running Kubernetes or Docker networking on OpenStack, even greater performance gains can be delivered.

Since no special kernel modules are hypervisor modifications are required, Romana works equally well in the cloud when running containers on instances in EC2.

Romana's uniform layer 3 approach allows network functions to be inserted easily for traffic management and enables hybrid cloud deployment by allowing container orchestrations systems to transparently scale capacity across private and public clouds worldwide.
