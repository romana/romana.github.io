### Software Defined Networking for Cloud Native Applications

Romana is a new Software Defined Network (SDN) solution specifically designed for the unique requirement of Cloud Native applications.

Romana network software lets data center operators design and deploy multi-tenant cloud computing networks directly on their physical infrastructure without a virtual network overlay. Romana based networks are less expensive to build, easier to operate and deliver higher performance than overlay-based virtual networks. 

Romana network delivers over six times faster packet response times for common traffic patterns.  Romana's uniform layer 3 approach allows network functions to be inserted easily for traffic management and enables hybrid cloud deployment by allowing container orchestrations systems such as Kubernetes to transparently scale capacity across private and public clouds worldwide.
