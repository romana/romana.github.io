### Romana Cloud Native Software Defined Networking

This is the Cloud Native Post that show up on the homepage.

 Pani Networks has developed an innovative [Cloud Native](https://cncf.io/) SDN solution that lets data center operators design and deploy multi-tenant cloud computing networks directly on their physical infrastructure without a virtual network overlay. Pani based networks are less expensive to build, easier to operate and deliver higher performance than virtual networks managed by Enterprise SDN solutions. Compared to an overlay-based virtual network on OpenStack, the Pani solution delivers over six times faster packet response times for common traffic patterns.  Panis uniform layer 3 approach allows network functions to be easily inserted for traffic management and allows cloud orchestrations systems such as Kubernetes to transparently scale capacity across private and public clouds worldwide.
