The Bay Area Network Virtualization (BANV) Meetup group has invited Chris to speak at their next [Meetup on March 10](http://www.meetup.com/openvswitch/events/229046426/).

The BANV Meetup group has been around for a long time and has nearly 2500 members. They've hosted a number of highly influential network virtualization experts from the [Open vSwitch](http://www.meetup.com/openvswitch/events/203304432/), [Open Virtual Network (OVN)](http://www.meetup.com/openvswitch/events/223461243/) and [Open Network Operating System (ONOS)](http://www.meetup.com/openvswitch/events/220849074/) projects, to name just a few. We are proud and honored that Romana was selected to present to this group of influential developers and practitioners of network virtualization.

Chris will provide an overview of Romana Cloud Native SDN with an emphasis on how it is different from the more traditional forms of network visualization that rely on overlay networks.

He will also have a demo of Kubernetes running with Romana deployed as a Third Party resource showing some new network policy capabilities that will be available in the upcoming v1.2 release.

These event fill up quickly, so please RSVP as soon as as you can to be sure to get a spot.

Hope to see you all there.
