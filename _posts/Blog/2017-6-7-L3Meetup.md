We recently were invited to present at the Bay Area OpenStack Meetup to talk about some new [deployment options on IP fabrics](https://www.meetup.com/openstack/events/239889735/). 

Chris spoke about the new [Routed Provider Network](https://docs.openstack.org/newton/networking-guide/config-routed-networks.html) features and described how Romana can be used to implement multi-segment networks. The presentation was recorded and is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcSKQxzRnsU).

Separately, are also happy to announce today immediate available of [Romana v1.1](https://github.com/romana/romana). It is a minor release that cleans up a bunch of bugs that have come up since Romana v1.0 was introduced back in March.

One change worth noting about today's release is the replacement of our CNI plugin with a new Go-based implementation.  It runs much faster and installs more easily.

More details available [here](https://github.com/romana/romana).

Unfortunately, if you are looking to deploy OpenStack on a layer 3 IP fabric and need multi-segment or routed provider networks, you'll have to wait a little while longer. That requires some new IPAM features that will be available soon.
