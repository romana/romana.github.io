We were invited to be on the PacketPushers Priority Queue podcast a few weeks ago. It was release today and is available [here](http://packetpushers.net/podcast/podcasts/pq-show-84-cloud-network-complexity-vs-romana-io/).

Chris joined Ethan Banks and Greg Ferro to talk about Romana and how it works. 

Hope you enjoy it.
