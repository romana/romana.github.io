## Introduction
Romana is an open source network orchestration and management system that lets operators build scalable multi-tenant, multi-cloud networks more easily than ever before. Unlike existing multi-tenant architectures designed to network individual virtual machines scattered across virtualization hosts within a datacenter, Romana focuses on the workload requirements of today's Cloud Native Applications with an application level, service oriented view and solves it in a simple, consistent and uniform way.

Central to Romana's (xxxx approach is a new L3 based tenancy model that is intuitive and easy to deploy across hosts, racks, datacenters and the WAN.
