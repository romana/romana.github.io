### First Live Public Demonstration of Kubernetes v1.2 with Network Policy
---

Last night we had the good fortune to be invited to present one of the Lightening Talks at the [Bay Area Kubernetes Meetup]( http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Kubernetes-Meetup/events/228213245/).

Tim Hockin was there with an overview of the upcoming v1.2 release and had some very good live demos of the new features.

Here are his [slides]( https://speakerdeck.com/thockin/news-from-the-front-v1-dot-2).



[Chris Marino]( https://twitter.com/chris_marino) gave an overview of Romana and described how Cloud Native applications are different from legacy Enterprise apps and how this drove very different network requirements for software defined networking. You can see his slides [here]( http://www.slideshare.net/RomanaProject/cloud-native-sdn).

[Robert Starmer]( https://kumul.us/about/) from [Kumul.us](kumul.us) then gave a live demo of Kubernetes running with Romana networks. The demo included a first tenant (t1) launching two individual Pods each with a tier label 'frontend' and 'backend' as show below:

	apiVersion: v1
	 kind: Pod
	 metadata:
	  name: nginx-frontend
	  labels:
	    app: nginx
	    owner: t1
	    tier: frontend
	 spec:
	 containers:
	   - name: nginx
	    image: nginx
	    ports:
	   - containerPort: 80

	apiVersion: v1
	 kind: Pod
	 metadata:
	  name: nginx-frontend
	  labels:
	   app: nginx
	   owner: t1
	   tier: backend
	 spec:
	 containers:
	   - name: nginx
	   image: nginx
	  ports:
	  - containerPort: 80

There is work being done in the Kubernetes Network SIG to define Network Policy and a way to isolate networks for multi-tenancy. The latest proposal is to use a namespace to define a tenant. However, in this demo we simply use the label 'owner' to specify tenancy. In addition, there is still ongoing discussion around the default policy that describes which Pods can communicate within a namespace

A second tenant (t2) was created with three nginx Pods using a replication controller.

	apiVersion: v1
	kind: ReplicationController
	metadata:
	 name: nginx-default
	spec:
	 replicas: 3
	 template:
	  metadata:
	   labels:
	    app: guestbook
	    tier: default
	    owner: t2
	spec:
	  containers:
	   - name: nginx-default
	    image: nginx
	    ports:
	     containerPort: 80


Network Policy in Kubernetes takes advantage of ThirdPartyResource objects. By creating a ThirdPartyResource, a new API endpoint is creates that can be watched for activity on those resources. 

	name: network-policy.romana.io
	apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
	kind: ThirdPartyResource
	description: 'Romana Network Policy Third Party Resource Schema'
	versions:
	 - name: demo/v1


Results in the creation of this API endpoint


	/apis/romana.io/demo/v1/networkpolicy/

Romana has built a Policy Manager that listens for activity on this API endpoint and configures the network with the specified policy.

A NetworkPolicy such as the one shown below can then be specified to apply specific network policy to selected Pods.

	kind: NetworkPolicy
	apiVersion: romana.io/demo/v1
	metadata:
	 name: policy1
	 namespace: default
	 labels:
	 - owner: t1
	 spec:
	  podSelector:		// Standard label selector - selects pods.
	   tier: backend
	 allowIncoming:		// (Optional) List of allow rules.
	  - toPorts:		// (Optional) List of dest ports to open.
	  - port: 80		// (Optional) Numeric or named port 
	  protocol: TCP		// [ TCP | UDP]
	 from:			// (Optional) List of sources.
	  - pods:		// (Optional) Standard label selector.
	  tier: frontend	// (Optional) Standard label selector.

This particular policy allows TCP traffic on port 80 to arrive from Tenant t1's Pods labeled 'frontend' to the Pods labeled 'backend'

In the demo, Robert started the replication controller and the frontend and backend Pods. He then showed that traffic could not reach either the frontend or backend Pods from tenant t2's Pods. This showed network multi-tenancy.

Then, he showed that tenant t1 traffic could not reach the backend Pods from the frontend Pods. Then he applied the NetworkPolicy at which point traffic could reach the pods.  This showed the application of the specified network policy and enforcement across application tiers.

There's still a lot more work to do for complete policy based networking, but this is an exciting start. We'll be releasing the code for this as soon as possible so that you can try it out for youself.

The Meetup was recorded and you can watch the Romana presentation and demo [starting at 37:00]( https://youtu.be/ab7mXAddaX8?t=37m14s).
